He would take important quotes and themes from these various forms of media and incorporate them into his work. He would create various text and typography to try and mimic the theme of the various movies or books he weas portraying through his work.

Although the piece can look quite busy, the repetition of the pattern allows users to feel how busy the bees are, flying from flower to flower, collecting nectar to bring to their hives. I decided to etch the honeycombs because often, when we interact with bees, we see bees racing from flower to flower, but do not typically see their hives. However, when we often think of bees and patterns, their honeycombs are often the first thing that subconsciously comes to mind. In addition to this, etching also created some very interesting shadows and in some scenarios, allowed the honeycombs to have 'depth' and a three-dimensional feel, like real honeycombs.",
            "I wanted the focus of the piece to be the bees, drawing in the users' eyes to the repetition of the bees with their eye-catching yellow colour. Following that, I wanted the users' eyes to eventually be drawn to the 'oddly coloured' flowers that surround the bees in what feels like the background. I chose this particular vinyl for the flowers because I wanted to try and imitate how bees see them, seeing UV colours and being pulled towards the centre of the flower where the nectar would be. Finally, I decided to etch honeycombs into the background because it created about a 10%-20% opacity, which resembles how bees cannot see the honeycombs within their hives but use their other senses to navigate and find their way around the hives instead.",

Although Tim suggested a few software for creating 3D models, I was very curious if Blender would have been possible to create such 3D models that are appropriate for the machine.

So initially, I was very interested about using the embroidery machine to try and experiment with different stitch techniques and see how it impacted the pattern / design. However, when Tim was introducing the machines to us, he mentioned that it is one of the most difficult / hardest machines of all the options to work with.

Although the laser cutter creates black and white like designs on wood by burning into it, I thought the effect was extremely interesting. Especially with different materials (such as different pieces of wood), the laser cutter would create different looks / shades when burning into the material. He also showed us an example of a “gradient” created by the laser cutter on wood and thought it was a very cool effect. Since every piece of wood has their own natural patterns within, using the laser cutter to create various depths can help show those natural markings, which could produce a different effect on the final project / design. Tim also showed us that you could use different formats to create the different “gradients”, which could also impact the final feel of the design. For gradients to work properly and show up well / distinctly, Tim suggested we used photoshop and use the scale 0 to 60 and only work in black and white. So, one thing this machine prevents is the use of colour because everything will be referenced based on a black and white design and on one piece of wood.",

It somewhat reminded me of the last project because the vinyl machine mostly just created cuts in special paper that was sticky on one side only. However, Tim, then, showed us a piece he was experimenting with, which used glass and etching cream. While looking at it, I was so intrigued. The glass was see through, but where the etching cream was used, it took on an opaquer look and had a very interesting texture. I was also thinking it could have been interesting to try and layer different vinyl cut outs to create more interesting visual effects. With both ideas in mind, I started wondering if I could even combine both, where the etching cream was on the very top layer of the glass, and the vinyl cut outs were layered behind. I thought it would have been interesting to see the contrast between the etching cream, transparency of the glass, and the vibrant colours of the cut outs all working together. I was also considering separating the vinyl cut out layers by placing glass between them to create more depth to the project and design.",
